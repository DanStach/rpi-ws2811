# rpi-ws2811
This project has the goal completing all the coding needed use ws2811 neopixel lights using a raspberry pi, for my xmas tree. most neopixels effects are written in C++, however i was only able to use a rpi with my ws2811 using python. I am porting all the c++ examples to python.

### Hardware Considerations
- RPI 3b 
  - SD = 16gb, Ram = 1gb,  CPU = 4Ã— 1.2GHz
  - OS = Raspbian
  - neopixel = 50 WS2811 (powered from RPI +5v pinout)
- RPI - 0W
  - pending...
- 6.5ft tree
- 300 programmable led (WS2811)
- 2 power supplies (each 5volt/10Amp)
